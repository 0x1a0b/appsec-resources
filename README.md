# Learning Application Security 

## Introduction

Some of the oldest known application security issues continue to affect projects
today. Being aware of these issues, as well as techniques for exploiting and
mitigating them, will aid in your testing efforts and help you to avoid
vulnerabilities in your own code. The resources below should help you learn more
about common security issues, and how to prevent these issues from surfacing in
new products/product features.

## OWASP Top 10

The [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10) is a list
of common vulnerabilities, as assessed by [OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project.](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page)
It is re-evaluated periodically based on the findings that they see in the wild.
OWASP's wiki has some very helpful articles about testing for and fixing many
common security issues.

Understanding the basics of each of these is essential to any security engineer.

The top 10 issues for 2013 are:

1. **[Injection (such as SQL or LDAP injection)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A1-Injection)**
2. **[Broken authentication and session management](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A2-Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management)**
3. **[Cross-site scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_%28XSS%29)**
4. **[Insecure direct object references](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References)**
5. **[Security misconfiguration](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A5-Security_Misconfiguration)**
6. **[Sensitive data exposure](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A6-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)**
7. **[Missing function level access control](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A7-Missing_Function_Level_Access_Control)**
8. **[Cross-site request forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A8-Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29)**
9. **[Using components with known vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities)**
10. **[Unvalidated redirects and forwards](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A10-Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards)**
